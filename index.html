                  Half of the public open space on private development in Hong Kong are unsatisfactory in terms of location and environment, according to Cha Kin-wang,  project manager of the non-profit organisation, Hong Kong Public Space Initiative (HKPSI). 
<br> <br> 
But we happened to come across a well-equipped and user-friendly natural retreat for the public on Shan Nam Road in Taipo. At 7,000 square feet, the area contains a sports ground, hiking trails, two barbecue pits, parking space, toilets and shower rooms. Management staff at the sports ground were welcoming and asked our reporter to freely use the space. 
<br> <br>
After the media outcry a year ago, Metro Harbor View in Tai Kok Tsui has become more welcoming and visible as a public space. The entrance on Fuk Lee Street is still not easily seen yet the sign on the front entrance stated the opening hours clearly and declared that it was a public space. 
<br> <br>
As our reporter took the stairs up, there was a road sign pointing the direction to the public area for every two meters. Boards and warnings stating the do’s and don’ts at the public space were everywhere. Finally reaching the Podium after taking two sets of stairs, our reporter saw the open space dotted with playgrounds, fountains and greeneries with children roaming around on Sunday. When asked whether they were residents of Metro Harbor View, a couple said they were just nearby residents who took their children to the public space every once in a while.
